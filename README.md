RebornXP is an effort to bring back the late 2000's personal computing experience right to your desktop, but in a moden way.

I always remembered the nostalgic feeling of Windows XP which is now discontinued and unfortunately gone from everyone's heart, so I decided to continue this project. It is highly inspired from the metro design of Windows 10.
